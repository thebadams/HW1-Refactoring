# Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc Refactoring

## Description
   As part of a Homework Assignment for for the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp cohort, I was given an html file and corresponding css file and asked to bring the code up to accessabiltiy standards, and adjust the stylesheet accordingly.


## Steps Taken
    * Fix Any Errors in Code
    * Replace non-semantic html tags with html ones
    * Adjust existing html to reflect current accessability standards
    * Adjust css to increase ease of maintainenance.
    * Remove extraneous classes and change the necessary css to reflect these changes
    * Make sure that the webpage still functions in the way that it should when done.
