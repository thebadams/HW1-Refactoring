1. Changed div.header to header.header
2. Changed heart symbol to &hearts;
3. Changed header.header to nav.header ->clarify which is better at a later date
4. Changed div.content to main.content ->clarify usage here - would a general <section> tag work better?
5. Changed div.footer to footer.footer -> maybe header should remain header if we have a footer tag?
6. Changed div.benefits to section.benefits
7. changed title of webpage to "Horiseon Social Solution Services"
8. Consolidated all of the .benefit-xxxx h3 - those h3's are the only h3's on the page, so it's unnecesary to ha 3 different style rules
9. Consolidate .benefit-xxx rules into one rule under .benefits div
10. Change .benefits div selector to list out .benefit-xxxx
11. Added alt attributes to all the images
12. Got rid of an extraneous </img> tag.
13. Changes div.search-engine-optimization to div#search-engine-optimization to work with link
14. Next Step: get rid of classes and adjust style.css accordingly?
